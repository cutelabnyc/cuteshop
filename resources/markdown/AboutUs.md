CuteLab is an electronic instrument manufacturer, performance venue, and community space
located in Gowanus, Brooklyn.

We build our instruments to explore engineering as a creative process. Through this
practice we try to make interfaces that we would use in our own musical work. We're
interested in hearing new sounds, and in designing tools that approach making music in a
new way.

Our combined hobbies include cooking Armenian cuisine, writing commutative diagrams in
LaTeX, and practicing the ondes martenot.

We couldn't do what we do without our dear friends at [Lowlands](http://lowlandsbar.com/)
and [Boran](http://boranrestaurant.com/).
